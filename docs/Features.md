# Features

So far TinyWatchy consists of following features, with easy way of adding new ones:

- **Power Efficiency**: TinyWatchy focuses on long battery life. Therefore focus is on offline operation with sudden bursts of online communication rather than staying online. This might be preferable to others and not preferable toâ€¦ others.
- **Simplicity**: TinyWatchy's code is OOP (Object Oriented Programming), written with industry standards and simplified for ease of developing, debugging and for newcomers.
- **Customization**: TinyWatchy's code keeps watchfaces and features as very basic but very powerful blocks. You can make very simple features and watchfaces but nothing is stopping you from doing whatever you want inside them. There's almost no limitation except than keeping to the UI/UX standards.
- **Many watchfaces**: TinyWatchy allows for adding multiple watchfaces as well as switching between them on the fly. Each watchface's limitation is only that it has to display every information provided to it.
- **NTP Sync**: TinyWatchy allows for syncing time using NTP over WiFi.
- **Accelerometer**: TinyWatchy uses accelerometer for means of waking up the device. Instead of waking up the device every minute to update time, double tap gesture of accelerometer is used to wake up and update time.
- **Step counter**: Step counter feature of accelerometer is available, it turns off at night to preserve battery but the hours are configurable.
- **More to come**: Standard bs
